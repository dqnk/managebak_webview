# PROJECT STALLED
Project is stalled indefinitely, because Managebac has added a CAPTCHA to their login website.

## What is this?
This is a React Native webview app for Android devices for displaying Managebac's web platform for schools.

## Why did you make a separate app if Managebac already provides their own?
Because the proprietary app from Managebac runs slow and often crashes (at least on Android).

## How do I build/set up the development environment?
Read CONTRIBUTING.md.
